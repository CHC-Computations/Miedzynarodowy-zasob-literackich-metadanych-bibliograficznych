# Introduction to Our Bibliographic Metadata Collection

The **Literary Bibliography Research Infrastructure (LiBRI)** is a result of a collaborative initiative between the *Czech Literary Bibliography (Institute of Czech Literature, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague)* and the *Polish Literary Bibliography (Institute for Literary Research, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw)*. Our fundamental objective is to compile, harmonize, and provide access to bibliographical databases for the expansive domain of literary studies.

## Our Extensive Repository

Our endeavor has crossed national boundaries, aggregating data from Czech, Polish, Finnish, and Spanish literary sources. Our repository is enriched with data collected from reputable institutions such as the National Libraries of Poland, Finland, and Spain, in addition to data from the Spanish Database Dialnet. The meticulously curated collection consists of over 4.5 million records, all conforming to the MARC21 standard.

## Data Acquisition and Selection Criteria

The data curation process involved obtaining bibliographic records in MARC21 format via data dumps and APIs, utilizing the Universal Decimal Classification alongside subject headings and genres to filter and extract Finnish literary data from [www.finto.fi](http://www.finto.fi). Spanish articles, initially in Dublin Core format from the Dialnet database, were meticulously converted to the MARC21 format to ensure a uniform data structure across our repository.

## Enrichment of Our Metadata

The scope of our endeavor extends beyond data collection to data enrichment. Our records have been augmented with external VIAF and ISSN identifiers, thus enhancing the quality of our data. Additionally, we have enriched our records with subject headings from the ELB (field 650) and have introduced a higher level of granularity by incorporating major genre information (fields 380, 381).

## Key Features of Our Metadata Resource

Our repository is not only extensive but also precise and standardized. VIAF Identifiers have been integrated within our data for Institutions, Authors, and Subject Headings from field 600. Standardized genres and subject headings are prominently featured, ensuring a coherent and globally recognized categorization. We have also rectified omissions by adding missing ISSN and standardizing journal names, thereby facilitating streamlined source identification and academic usage.

## Data Unification Process

In our pursuit of data excellence, we initiated a process to unify data about authors and sources based on external identifiers like VIAF and ISSN. The unification began with Polish data, integrating the Polish Literary Bibliography with the National Library of Poland, and subsequently extended to all sources to ensure a harmonized and enriched data landscape.

## Utilization of This Resource

The potential applications of our carefully curated and enriched metadata are vast. It serves as a robust foundation for databases, aiding in bibliography creation, data linking & integration, data analysis & visualization, and much more. Our data is freely available on the [Zenodo platform](https://zenodo.org) under a CC0 license, inviting researchers, institutions, data analysts, librarians, and software developers to explore and utilize the literary metadata.

## Accessibility and Licensing

Our collections are openly accessible on the [Zenodo platform](https://zenodo.org), under the liberal CC0 license, permitting a wide range of usages. The data, structured in the MARC21 format and enriched with VIAF identifiers, stands as a powerful resource for the academic and research community.
